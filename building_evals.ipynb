    "Optimizing Claude to give you the highest possible accuracy on a task is an empirical science, and a process of continuous improvement. Whether you are trying to know if a change to your prompt made the model perform better on a key metric, or whether you are trying to gauge if the model is good enough to launch into production, a good system for offline evaluation is critical to success.\n",

    "## Parts of an Eval\n",
    "Evals typically have four parts.\n",
    "- An input prompt that is fed to the model. We will ask Claude to generate a completion based on this prompt. Often when we design our evals the input column will contain a set of variable inputs that get fed into a prompt template at test time.\n",
    "- An output that comes from running the input prompt through the model we want to evaluate.\n",
    "- A \"golden answer\" to which we compare the model output. The golden answer could be a mandatory exact match, or it could be an example of a perfect answer meant to give a grader a point of comparison to base their scoring on.\n",
    "- A score, generated by one of the grading methods discussed below, that represents how the model did on the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Eval Grading Methods\n",
    "There are two things about evals that can be time consuming and expensive. The first is writing the questions and golden answers for the eval. The second is grading. Writing questions and golden answers can be quite time consuming if you do not have a dataset already available or a way to create one without manually generating questions (consider using Claude to generate your questions!), but has the benefit of typically being a one-time fixed cost. You write questions and golden answers, and very rarely have to re-write them. Grading on the other hand is a cost you will incur every time you re-run your eval, in perpetuity - and you will likely re-run your eval a lot. As a result, building evals that can be quickly and cheaply graded should be at the center of your design choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three common ways to grade evals.\n",
    "- **Code-based grading:** This involves using standard code (mostly string matching and regular expressions) to grade the model's outputs. Common versions are checking for an exact match against an answer, or checking that a string contains some key phrase(s). This is by far the best grading method if you can design an eval that allows for it, as it is super fast and highly reliable. However, many evaluations do not allow for this style of grading.\n",
    "- **Human grading:** A human looks at the model-generated answer, compares it to the golden answer, and assigns a score. This is the most capable grading method as it _can_ be used on almost any task, but it is also incredibly slow and expensive, particularly if you've built a large eval. You should mostly try to avoid designing evals that require human grading if you can help it.\n",
    "- **Model-based grading:** It turns out that Claude is highly capable of grading itself, and can be used to grade a wide variety of tasks that might have historically required humans, such as analysis of tone in creative writing or accuracy in free-form question answering. You do this by writing a _grader prompt_ for Claude.\n",
    "\n",
